# HEART_HEALTH_PREDICTION
This Python app uses Tkinter for a GUI that predicts heart disease risk using a trained logistic regression model. Users enter health data, get a risk prediction with probability, and can compare their values to dataset averages through a graph, making health analysis interactive and simple.
